Brief summary:
This app is aiming to provide a calendar and pomodoro timer for people to plan their daily work. The idea of this timer is based on pomodoro technique, which uses a timer to break work into intervals. Each completed task will be marked as a star in each user’s skymap. In addition, to encourage users finishing their tasks, users can see and compare their skymaps with their friends’. 

Difficulty:
1. We wanna put ‘user’ as a controller, but we don’t know how to achieve it.
2. We’re unfamiliar with the Android platform and its API’s. Therefore, we can only write abstract classes without knowing how to implement some of the methods in the class. In addition, we are struggling about how to visualize and test our program.

What has worked well?
We were struggling with clean architecture before, we thought this is the reason that we were not able to visualize our program. But we finally realized that the problem is we don’t know how to build our app with the Android platform APIs.  We did a lot of research on developing an android app on github, and now we finally are on the right track.

Next Step:
We are planning to learn how to use the Android platform, and import the Android API’s to help us implement the methods and change the structure of our code respectively.
